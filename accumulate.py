"""Accumulate usage stats across runs so the burn graph never shrinks.

Claude Code prunes local transcripts (`cleanupPeriodDays`, default 30) and Codex
rotates its rollouts, so engine.compute_*() over the *live* logs only ever covers
a rolling recent window. collect.py recomputes that window each run; this module
merges it with the previously published stats.json so a day we have already
captured is retained even after its raw transcript is deleted.

Merge rule (per tool):
- daily[]: union by date, keeping the row with the larger `tokens`. A past day is
  immutable once it ends, so a partially-pruned recompute is smaller and the
  retained snapshot wins; today's row is still growing, so the fresh row wins.
- overview totals are RE-DERIVED from the merged daily[] (so Σdaily == overview
  stays true, which the SPA and hero both rely on).
- hourCounts / models / subagents hold data not present in daily[] (hour-of-day
  histogram, per-model in/out/cache split), so they are max-merged field by field
  and therefore never decrease.

Consequence: accumulated totals intentionally exceed what the Claude app shows
(the app also only sees the un-pruned window). engine.py stays a faithful 1:1
reimplementation; accumulation is layered on top at publish time only.
